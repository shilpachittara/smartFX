üåç SmartFX ‚Äî Stablecoin Cross-Currency Swaps with EigenLayer Proofs

SmartFX is a proof-verified stablecoin FX swap dApp, built for the Celo blockchain.
It enables trust-minimized swaps between stablecoins (e.g., cUSD ‚Üî cREAL) using off-chain FX rates signed by a trusted oracle/signer, verified on-chain by smart contracts.

The app is fully frontend-only (no backend server required), using MetaMask or MiniPay for signing and execution.

‚ú® Features
	‚Ä¢	Cross-currency stablecoin swaps
Swap between Celo-native stablecoins (cUSD, cREAL, cEUR) at FX rates verified by cryptographic proofs.
	‚Ä¢	EigenLayer-verified rates
Uses an EigenLayer signer (configurable address) to sign rate proofs off-chain.
	‚Ä¢	Demo: Your own MetaMask wallet can act as _eigenSigner for signing in the browser.
	‚Ä¢	Production: A dedicated EigenLayer AVS (Actively Validated Service) or oracle can act as the signer.
	‚Ä¢	Vault-settled design
The contract holds liquidity in a vault. Incoming token is swapped for outgoing token, secured by proof-verified FX rate.
	‚Ä¢	Frontend-only flow
	‚Ä¢	Browser fetches FX rate (USD/BRL or manual input).
	‚Ä¢	User wallet signs the quote hash (same as _eigenSigner).
	‚Ä¢	Contract verifies the proof and executes the swap.
	‚Ä¢	Security measures
	‚Ä¢	Non-replayable quotes (quoteHash).
	‚Ä¢	Slippage protection (minAmountOut).
	‚Ä¢	Expiry windows (maxQuoteAge).
	‚Ä¢	Owner controls signer and vault balances.
	‚Ä¢	Modern DeFi UI with Web3 aesthetics
	‚Ä¢	Cyber-blue color scheme with Celo green accents
	‚Ä¢	Real-time output calculation with animated feedback
	‚Ä¢	Loading spinners and user-friendly error messages
	‚Ä¢	Glowing buttons with hover effects and pulse animations
	‚Ä¢	Success notifications with transaction links
	‚Ä¢	Input validation with immediate feedback
	‚Ä¢	Mobile-responsive design

üöÄ Getting Started

Prerequisites
	‚Ä¢	Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
	‚Ä¢	MetaMask browser extension
	‚Ä¢	Celo wallet funded with testnet cUSD / cREAL (use Celo Alfajores Faucet)

1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/shilpachittara/smartFX
cd smartFX/SmartFXUI/smartfx
npm install

2. Configure environment

Create .env.local:

NEXT_PUBLIC_CELOFX_ADDRESS=0xA127C6aECb272935466B679234Ece1BFdF1953b7
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=44787
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_EXPLORER=https://alfajores.celoscan.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_FROM_TOKEN=0x874069Fa1Eb16D44d622F2e0Ca25eeA172369bC1   # cUSD
NEXT_PUBLIC_TO_TOKEN=0x7D00cd74FF385c955EA3d79e47BF06bD7386387D     # cREAL

3. Run locally
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000

**Note:** The UI will work for anyone, but successful on-chain swaps require your wallet to be set as the contract's `eigenSigner`. See the "Demo Mode Limitations" section below for details.


üîó Smart Contract
	‚Ä¢	Contract: SmartFX.sol
	‚Ä¢	Key methods:
	‚Ä¢	swapWithProof(...) ‚Äî executes swap with ECDSA proof verification.
	‚Ä¢	quoteHash(...) ‚Äî deterministic hash used for signing.
	‚Ä¢	setEigenSigner(address) ‚Äî owner sets trusted signer.
	‚Ä¢	rescue(...) ‚Äî owner withdraws vault tokens for rebalancing.


üìñ How EigenLayer is used
	‚Ä¢	SmartFX integrates EigenLayer by requiring all FX rates to be signed by an EigenSigner.
	‚Ä¢	The EigenSigner can be:
	1.	Demo ‚Äî your MetaMask address (frontend signs in-browser).
	2.	Production ‚Äî an EigenLayer AVS or oracle service, where multiple EigenLayer-secured nodes produce signed rates.
	‚Ä¢	The smart contract verifies these signatures with ECDSA.recover.
	‚Ä¢	This ensures that only EigenLayer-verified FX rates are accepted for swaps.


üß≠ Future Roadmap
	‚Ä¢	Multi-pair support
Add cUSD ‚Üî cEUR, cUSD ‚Üî cKES, and more Celo stable pairs.
	‚Ä¢	Advanced oracle integration
Replace demo MetaMask signing with a real EigenLayer AVS providing rate feeds.
	‚Ä¢	Liquidity incentives
Vault staking and yield distribution for liquidity providers.
	‚Ä¢	MiniApp Integration
Wrap into a Celo MiniPay MiniApp for instant mobile UX.
	‚Ä¢	Cross-chain stablecoin FX
Extend to Ethereum / L2 stablecoins using Axelar or LayerZero bridging.
	‚Ä¢	AI x DeFi Agents
Add AI agents to auto-rebalance vaults, monitor arbitrage, or auto-swap at best rates.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Demo Mode Limitations

**Current Implementation Status:**

This is a **Proof-of-Concept** demonstrating the EigenLayer integration architecture. In the current deployment:

**‚úÖ What Works:**
- UI/UX flow (wallet connection, rate fetching, signing interface)
- Smart contract with full security measures (signature verification, replay protection, slippage guards)
- Real FX rate fetching from multiple providers
- Complete on-chain transaction execution

**‚ö†Ô∏è Demo Constraint:**

The deployed contract's `eigenSigner` is set to a **specific wallet address** (the deployer's wallet). This means:

- ‚úÖ **Anyone can view** the UI and interact with the interface
- ‚úÖ **Anyone can fetch** live FX rates
- ‚úÖ **Anyone can sign** quotes with their MetaMask
- ‚ùå **Only the authorized signer's wallet** can successfully execute swaps on-chain

**Why This Design?**

This demonstrates the **trust model** of the full system:
1. **Demo Mode** (current): Single MetaMask wallet acts as the EigenSigner to prove the concept
2. **Production Mode** (roadmap): A decentralized EigenLayer AVS (Actively Validated Service) with multiple validators replaces the single signer

**For Hackathon Judges/Testers:**

To experience a successful swap transaction:
1. **Option A**: Watch the deployer demonstrate with their authorized wallet
2. **Option B**: Contact the team to temporarily set your wallet as the `eigenSigner` via the `setEigenSigner()` function
3. **Option C**: Review the [contract on Celoscan](https://alfajores.celoscan.io/address/0xA127C6aECb272935466B679234Ece1BFdF1953b7) to verify transaction history

**Pre-Demo Checklist:**

Before presenting, ensure:
- [ ] Wallet has Alfajores testnet CELO (for gas)
- [ ] Wallet has testnet cUSD (get from [Celo Faucet](https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores))
- [ ] Contract has sufficient cREAL liquidity
- [ ] Your wallet address matches the contract's `eigenSigner` setting
- [ ] Network is set to Celo Alfajores (Chain ID: 44787)

**Common Errors (with friendly messages):**

The UI now shows user-friendly error messages instead of technical errors:

| Technical Error | User-Friendly Message |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "bad sig" | üîê Signature verification failed. Your wallet must be set as the contract's eigenSigner for demo mode. |
| "insufficient liquidity" | üíß The contract doesn't have enough cREAL tokens. Please contact the team to add liquidity. |
| "stale quote" | ‚è∞ Your signed rate expired (5 min limit). Please fetch a new rate and sign again. |
| "quote used" | ‚ôªÔ∏è This signature was already used. Please create a new quote. |
| "user rejected action" | üö´ You cancelled the request. Please try again when ready. |
| "insufficient funds" | üí∞ Insufficient balance. You need more CELO for gas or cUSD for the swap. |
