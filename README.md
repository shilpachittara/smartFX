üåç SmartFX ‚Äî Stablecoin Cross-Currency Swaps with EigenLayer Proofs

SmartFX is a proof-verified stablecoin FX swap dApp, built for the Celo blockchain.
It enables trust-minimized swaps between stablecoins (e.g., cUSD ‚Üî cREAL) using off-chain FX rates signed by a trusted oracle/signer, verified on-chain by smart contracts.

The app is fully frontend-only (no backend server required), using MetaMask or MiniPay for signing and execution.

‚ú® Features
	‚Ä¢	Cross-currency stablecoin swaps
Swap between Celo-native stablecoins (cUSD, cREAL, cEUR) at FX rates verified by cryptographic proofs.
	‚Ä¢	EigenLayer-verified rates
Uses an EigenLayer signer (configurable address) to sign rate proofs off-chain.
	‚Ä¢	Demo: Your own MetaMask wallet can act as _eigenSigner for signing in the browser.
	‚Ä¢	Production: A dedicated EigenLayer AVS (Actively Validated Service) or oracle can act as the signer.
	‚Ä¢	Vault-settled design
The contract holds liquidity in a vault. Incoming token is swapped for outgoing token, secured by proof-verified FX rate.
	‚Ä¢	Frontend-only flow
	‚Ä¢	Browser fetches FX rate (USD/BRL or manual input).
	‚Ä¢	User wallet signs the quote hash (same as _eigenSigner).
	‚Ä¢	Contract verifies the proof and executes the swap.
	‚Ä¢	Security measures
	‚Ä¢	Non-replayable quotes (quoteHash).
	‚Ä¢	Slippage protection (minAmountOut).
	‚Ä¢	Expiry windows (maxQuoteAge).
	‚Ä¢	Owner controls signer and vault balances.
	‚Ä¢	Cute minimal UI
	‚Ä¢	Connect wallet (MetaMask / MiniPay).
	‚Ä¢	Enter amount ‚Üí Fetch rate ‚Üí Sign proof ‚Üí Swap.
	‚Ä¢	Shows proof JSON and on-chain tx link.

üöÄ Getting Started

Prerequisites
	‚Ä¢	Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
	‚Ä¢	MetaMask browser extension
	‚Ä¢	Celo wallet funded with testnet cUSD / cREAL (use Celo Alfajores Faucet)

1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/shilpachittara/smartFX
cd smartfx
npm install

2. Configure environment

Create .env.local:

NEXT_PUBLIC_CELOFX_ADDRESS=0xA127C6aECb272935466B679234Ece1BFdF1953b7
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=44787
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_EXPLORER=https://alfajores.celoscan.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_FROM_TOKEN=0x874069Fa1Eb16D44d622F2e0Ca25eeA172369bC1   # cUSD
NEXT_PUBLIC_TO_TOKEN=0x7D00cd74FF385c955EA3d79e47BF06bD7386387D     # cREAL

3. Run locally
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000


üîó Smart Contract
	‚Ä¢	Contract: SmartFX.sol
	‚Ä¢	Key methods:
	‚Ä¢	swapWithProof(...) ‚Äî executes swap with ECDSA proof verification.
	‚Ä¢	quoteHash(...) ‚Äî deterministic hash used for signing.
	‚Ä¢	setEigenSigner(address) ‚Äî owner sets trusted signer.
	‚Ä¢	rescue(...) ‚Äî owner withdraws vault tokens for rebalancing.


üìñ How EigenLayer is used
	‚Ä¢	SmartFX integrates EigenLayer by requiring all FX rates to be signed by an EigenSigner.
	‚Ä¢	The EigenSigner can be:
	1.	Demo ‚Äî your MetaMask address (frontend signs in-browser).
	2.	Production ‚Äî an EigenLayer AVS or oracle service, where multiple EigenLayer-secured nodes produce signed rates.
	‚Ä¢	The smart contract verifies these signatures with ECDSA.recover.
	‚Ä¢	This ensures that only EigenLayer-verified FX rates are accepted for swaps.


üß≠ Future Roadmap
	‚Ä¢	Multi-pair support
Add cUSD ‚Üî cEUR, cUSD ‚Üî cKES, and more Celo stable pairs.
	‚Ä¢	Advanced oracle integration
Replace demo MetaMask signing with a real EigenLayer AVS providing rate feeds.
	‚Ä¢	Liquidity incentives
Vault staking and yield distribution for liquidity providers.
	‚Ä¢	MiniApp Integration
Wrap into a Celo MiniPay MiniApp for instant mobile UX.
	‚Ä¢	Cross-chain stablecoin FX
Extend to Ethereum / L2 stablecoins using Axelar or LayerZero bridging.
	‚Ä¢	AI x DeFi Agents
Add AI agents to auto-rebalance vaults, monitor arbitrage, or auto-swap at best rates.


üì∏ Demo Flow (1 min)
	1.	Connect wallet on Celo.
	2.	Enter amount in cUSD.
	3.	Fetch live USD‚ÜíBRL rate or type manually.
	4.	Sign the quote (MetaMask ‚Üí ‚ÄúSign Message‚Äù).
	5.	Call swapWithProof on-chain.
	6.	Vault releases cREAL at the verified rate.
